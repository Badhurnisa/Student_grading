# Student Grade Management System

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The **Student Grade Management System** is a console-based Java application designed to store, manage, and process student academic records efficiently.  
It allows users to:
- Add new student entries with their marks  
- View all student records in alphabetical order  
- Calculate the average marks of the class  

The program applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, using a `Student` class to encapsulate details and a `Main` class to handle core logic.  
It leverages the **Java Collections Framework** for dynamic data management and **Java Serialization** for persistent storage, ensuring records remain available even after closing the application.
